## Different types of trees 
- **Full Trees**: Every descendant of a node either has two descendants or none. 
- **Complete Tree:** (Binary Heaps) When we fill out the tree, we fill it out from top to bottom and left to right. The tree must follow this order. 
- **Perfect Tree:** All leaves are on the same level and all of the nodes that have descendants have 2 children. 
	- A perfect tree is a full and complete tree.
