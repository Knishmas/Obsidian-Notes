Type of problem: Union find 
Refer to : [[Union Find]] notes.


# Notes
- Initially we're given a acyclical graph. A additional edge is then added between two existing vertices, creating a cycle. Our task is to find that edge that created the cycle and return it. 
- Given n nodes, n edges, & that all edges will be unique it is guaranteed that there will be a cycle within the graph. 
	*Example*

**Deep Dive: What creates the cycle?** 
- When adding an edge between two vertices, if there is a path that already exists connecting the two vertices, then we're creating a 2nd path connecting the two AKA creating the cycle 
	*Example*
	![[Pasted image 20230819131510.png||400]]
	- There is a path connecting nodes 1 and 3 (1 -> 4 -> 3)
	- If we add an edge directly connecting nodes 1 & 3 we will then have a new path connecting them. We will also create a cycle. 
	- The new path added is redundant because the two nodes already are connected & it will create a cycle. 

**The first edge that creates a redundant connection will be our return**

# Solution 
- **Method:** **Union find by rank**
- We're going to create a tree and unionize. Parent nodes is the root node.
- We will start with just nodes and no connections. 
- Go through the edges and unionize the specified nodes.
	- The node with the lower rank will be joining the node with the higher rank (if they're equal it doesn't which joins which)
	- Have a rank array and parent array, of size n (nodes), and update them as we unionize 
- Every time we're going to unionize two nodes, we're first going to find their parent. If both nodes parents are the same then that means they're already connected. This edge is our redundant connection and our return value. 

# Java solution 
```java
class Solution {
 int[] parent; 
 int[] rank; 

    public int[] findRedundantConnection(int[][] edges) {
        //Define parent and ranks 
        parent = new int[edges.length + 1]; 
        rank = new int[edges.length + 1];
        //populate arrays 
        for(int i = 1; i < edges.length; i++){
            parent[i] = i; 
            rank[i] = 1;
        }
        for(int[] edge : edges){
           if(find(edge[0]) == find(edge[1])) return edge;
           union(edge[0], edge[1]);
           
        }

        //for every edge check if they have the same parent 
            //if so return the edge 

        //otherwise return default [0,0]
        return new int[2];
    }

    //find helper function
   public int find(int x){
       if(x == parent[x]) return x; 
       return parent[x] = find(parent[x]); 
   }

    public void union(int x, int y){
       int rootX = find(x); 
       int rootY = find(y); 

        if(rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]){
            parent[rootY] = rootX; 
            rank[rootX]++; 
        } else if(rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]){
            parent[rootX] = rootY; 
            rank[rootY]++; 
        }else{
            parent[rootY] = rootX; 
            rank[rootX]++; 
        }
    }
    //union helper function
}
```
