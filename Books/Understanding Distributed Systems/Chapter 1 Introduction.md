## Intro
*What's a distributed system?*
- A group of nodes working together communicating over message links in order to achieve a task. 
*Why do we need distributed systems?*
- Some applications are inherently distributed. Such as the web. 
- Build fault tolerance. If 1 node fails then we can have another or multiple be there to handle the failure. 
- Horizontal Scaling. An application/service may have an enormous amount of computation to do and a single node can't be enough to handle it. We would need multiple.
